# Project Documentation: Contact Book Fullstack App

The deployed project can be accessed at http://209.38.216.33:3333/. \
The source code with explanatory comments is available on GitHub [repository](https://github.com/jesuisstan/ContactBookFullstackApp).

## Objective

The primary goal of this project was to develop a straightforward CRUD contact directory.

## Implementation

The project was implemented using functional components and popular hooks in ReactJS with TypeScript and [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started), leveraging the Material UI library for its components and styling, in addition to custom CSS modules. The Contact Book App was developed to be responsive, following a multi-platform approach. The following steps were taken to complete the project:

1.  **Backend + MongoDB implementation**: Backend was built with NodeJS and Express server to save time. Database (MongoDB) was attached to backend to store all contacts User would create or modify. Additionally I implemented authentication with email and nickname.

2. **Material UI, Custom Styling with CSS Modules & Custom Fonts**: Material UI components were utilized to achieve a consistent and visually appealing design. Components such as TextField, Drawer, Card and LoadingButton were used to create responsive and user-friendly web-app and related elements. The GTWalsheimPro font was installed and applied to the project to improve attractiveness of the App.

3. **Deployment**: The code was deployed on a Digital Ocean web server and made accessible through the [URL](http://209.38.216.33:3333/).

4. **Version Control**: The code was hosted on GitHub and made publicly accessible. The repository can be found at https://github.com/jesuisstan/ContactBookFullstackApp.

## Results

Deployed version of the App allows user to:

- get access to his contact list with authentication;

- search for specific contact by his Lastname;

- sort existing contacts by Lastnames;

- create a new contact by opening a side panel with empty fields;

- edit an existing contact by opening a side panel pre-filled with the contact's current information;

- delete a contact from the directory.

## Future Improvements

While the project has been successfully implemented and deployed, there are potential areas for improvement:

- **Unit Testing**: Implementing unit tests for the components and functionality of the Contact Book would help ensure the stability and maintainability of the codebase, allowing for easier future modifications and bug fixes.

- **Safari browser support** was not tested.

By addressing these areas for improvement, the project can be further optimized and polished, providing an even better user experience.

## How to use
##### 1. Adjust backend/.env and frontend/.env files if you need other HOST, PORT or MONGO vars.
##### 2. Adjust "proxy" line in frontend/package.json file so that it points to your Server

##### 3. Run the App:
a) with Docker:
- create docke image:
```sh
docker build -t contact-book-app .
```

- Start Contact Book Fullstack App:
```sh
docker run -p 9999:9999 -p 3333:3333 contact-book-app
```
OR

b) with NPM:
- install all the dependencies according to 'package.json' file from the root dir:
```sh
npm install
```

- Start Contact Book Fullstack App:
```sh
npm start
```

##### 4. Open the App link in browser ([http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) or [http://209.38.216.33:3333](http://209.38.216.33:3333) by default).

##### 5. Additional commands:
- to list all Docker container:
```sh
docker ps -a
```
- to list all Docker images:
```sh
docker images
```
- to stop all running containers:
```sh
